# Timer
## This app is an easy-to-use timer.

### Customize timer sound
- **Each sound file is recommended to be less than 1 second.**
- Timer sound: You will hear what you set in Normal, 30 seconds or less, and 3 seconds or less.
- Alert sound: The warning sound can be heard in 1 minute, 30 seconds and 10 seconds with the set sound.
- Timer end sound: There are two types of timer end sound, normal sound and simple sound. Simple sound is used when the silent count function is turned on.

### Silent count
- If it is on, the timer sound and alarm sound will not be heard. Also, a simple sound is used for the timer end sound.
- If it is off, you can hear both the timer sound and the alert sound, and the timer end sound is used as a normal sound.

### Localization
- Thank you for your contribution. There are two files to be localized: `Main.storyboard` and `ContentView.swift`.
